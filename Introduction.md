# Fire Detection Using CNN Model

## Overview

Fire is one of the deadliest risks any living things can encounter in their life. In a concise time frame, fire can wreck an area, say in a forest, hut, house, building,
etc. Fire can lead to the loss of expensive property, and in the worst possible scenario, it can also lead to the loss of human life. Detecting fire thus becomes a 
significant concern. 
This project will carry out fire detection by adopting an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) model based on chromatic and disorder measurement for extracting fire pixels. To prevent 
this, we have used an early fire detection using image segmentation with the help of the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model with alarm system and VGG16.

## Need for the study

Fire accidents kill 54 people daily in India, yet deaths have declined. Accidental fires caused 6% of all unnatural deaths in India, third-highest after car accidents 
53%, and drowning at 9%. During the period, the number of fire accidents reduced by 44 per cent - 16,695 in 2016 to 9,329 in 2020. Fire-related accidents have, on 
average, killed 35 people every day in the five years between 2016 and 2020, according to a report by Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India (ADSI), maintained by the
National Crime Records Bureau. Some of the incidences are : There was a fire in Virudhunagar fireworks factory in Tamil Nadu where 25 innocent people were killed. 
Massive fire engulfs Vizag chemical plant, explosions heard, injuries reported. Several people were injured in an explosion at a chemical factory in Andhra Pradesh's 
Visakhapatnam. The explosions were followed by a massive fire that was visible across the city. At least 12 fire tenders were deployed to douse the flames.

## Objective

Aim of this project is to locate the position where fire is present, which will help the authorities take proper measures to avoid any loss. This project aims to build
a deep neural network model that will give a goog accuracy in detecting fire. This is done using a set of fire and non fire images.
