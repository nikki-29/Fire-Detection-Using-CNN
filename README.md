# Fire-Detection-Using-CNN Model

## Problem Statement

To locate the position where fire is present, which will help the authorities take proper measures to avoid any loss. This project aims to build a deep neural network 
model that will give a good accuracy in detecting fire. This is done using fire and non fire images.

## Toolkit

Tensorflow

## Methodology

CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK is used to classify images as fire and non-fire. After images are being detected with fire, we implemented a small alarm sysytem to get 
notified. CNNs are a class of Deep Neural Networks that can recognize and classify particular features from images and are widely used for analyzing visual images.

## Learning Experience

We worked as a team of 6 members. It was a learning experience for all of us. Apart from CNN, we have worked on another model called VGG16. oth models have widened
our knowledge in the field of machine learning. Today we are happy for learning the basics of two models. We have learned to fix the errors that occurred during the
project with the help of our fellow mates. We have learned the working of CNN as well as VGG16. Each of it has its own features, uses and drawbacks. 
Apart from the project, we have learned to work in the team by lifting up each others and passing on our knowledge. As we have worked with two models and if someone 
asks which was better we will definitely suggest CNN model as we were able to fix alarm when model detects fire.
